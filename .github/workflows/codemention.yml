      # We don't want to run untrusted code from a fork (see

      # so if the PR is from a fork, we'll run the main branch instead.
      # Ideally, we would have an approval step for PRs from forks, but
      # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/approving-workflow-runs-from-public-forks
      # indicates workflows triggered by pull_request_target events are always
      # run regardless of approval settings.
